Shell Scripting Tutorial for Beginners
This tutorial will guide you through the basics of shell scripting, from creating your first script to exploring advanced topics.

1. Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have a basic understanding of:

Linux/Unix command-line interface (CLI): Familiarity with commands like ls, cd, mkdir, etc.
Text editors: You should know how to use editors like nano, vim, or gedit to create and edit files.
First Shell Script

A shell script is simply a file containing a series of commands. Let's create a basic "Hello, World!" script to get started.

Example: hello.sh

Bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal
echo "Hello, World!"
Use code with caution.

How to Run the Script:

Create the script: Save the above code in a file named hello.sh.
Make the script executable:
Bash
chmod +x hello.sh
Use code with caution.

chmod +x: This command changes the permissions of the file to make it executable.
Run the script:
Bash
./hello.sh
Use code with caution.

Output:

Hello, World!
File Permissions

When you create a script, you need to make it executable before you can run it. Use chmod to change the file permissions:

Bash
chmod +x filename
Use code with caution.

2. Shell Script Basics
Shebang (#!)

The first line in a shell script is usually the shebang (#!) followed by the path to the interpreter that should execute the script. The most common is #!/bin/bash, which tells the system to use the Bash shell.

Example: shebang_example.sh

Bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script demonstrates the use of shebang
echo "This script is running using Bash shell"
Use code with caution.

Variables

Variables store data that can be used later in the script. There are two types:

User-defined variables: Created by the user.
Environment variables: Predefined by the system.
Example: variables_example.sh

Bash
#!/bin/bash
# Variable examples
# User-defined variable
name="John Doe"
# Environment variable
path=$PATH
echo "User-defined variable: $name"
echo "Environment variable: $path"
Use code with caution.

Comments

Comments start with # and are ignored by the shell. They are useful for explaining what the script does.
