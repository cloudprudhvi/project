### Shell Script Basics

### **1: Understanding the Shell Environment**

#### **What is a Shell?**
- **Definition**: A shell is a user interface that provides access to various services of a computer's operating system, available in graphical or command-line forms.
- **Functionality**: Shells interpret commands, enabling interaction with the system through scripts or direct input.

#### **Different Types of Shells**
- **Bash (Bourne Again SHell)**: The most common default shell on Linux systems, used for the majority of scripting tasks.
- **Zsh (Z Shell)**: Known for its enhanced features over Bash, such as improved auto-completion and globbing capabilities.
- **Others (Korn Shell, C Shell, etc.)**: Useful in specific contexts; C Shell is favored in certain environments due to its C-like syntax.

### **2: Creating Your First Shell Script**

#### **Writing and Executing a Script**
- **Creating a Script File**
   - Use a text editor like `nano` or `vim` to create a new file and write your script. Start with the shebang line, followed by commands. For example:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "Hi, Mom!"
     ```

- **Making the Script Executable**
   - Modify the script's permissions to make it executable with `chmod`:
     ```bash
     chmod +x script.sh
     ```
   - Run the script by its path:
     ```bash
     ./script.sh
     ```

#### **Shell Script Structure and Syntax**
- **Basic Syntax Elements**
  - **Comments**: Begin with `#`, useful for adding descriptions and notes, except for the shebang.
  - **Echo Command**: Displays text or variable values.

#### **Using the Read Command**
- **Purpose**: The `read` command is used in shell scripts to capture input from the user.
- **Usage**: You can prompt the user for input, which is then stored in a variable for further use within the script.
- **Example**:
  - This script asks for the user's name and then greets them:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "What is your name?"
    read name
    echo "Hi, $name!"
    ```
